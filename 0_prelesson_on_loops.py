# While loops  

# for loops = execute a block of code a fixed number of times.
#               You can iterate a range, string, sequence, etc.

# for x in range(1, 11, 3): 
#    print(x)

# credit_card = "1234-5678-9012-3456"

# for x in credit_card:
#   print(x)

for x in range(1, 21):
    if x == 13:
        break
    else:
        print(x)
