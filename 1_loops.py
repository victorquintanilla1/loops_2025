# Example Practice:
# Given this list of fruits:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
print(len(fruits))
# Challenge:
# Use a for loop to print each fruit on a new line.
print(fruits[0])
print(fruits[1])
print(fruits[2])
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
# i just worked with loops

# Given a list of school subjects:
subjects = ["Math", "Science", "History", "Art"]
for subject in subjects:
    print(subject)
    print(len(subject))
   
# Challenge:
# Use a for loop and range to print each subject along with its index:
# Example output: "Subject 0: Math"


# Given:
numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20]

# Challenge:
# Use a for loop to add all the numbers and print the total.

for index in range(len(subjects)):
    print("Subject " + str(index) + ": " + subjects[index])

total = 0 
for number in numbers: 
    total += number
    print("total: " ,total)

# new_numbers = list(range(1,6001))
# This creates a list of numbers from 1 to 6001
# Challenge: Sum up all the unmbers from 1 to 6001
# and print the total

# total = 0
# for new_number in new_numbers:
#    total += number
#    print("total: " ,total)

# list = [1, 20]
